# Homework 1
## Decentralised Systems
Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server.
How would you solve the problems of
1. cheating
2. ensuring agreement about the state of the system
3. communication problems (timeouts)
4. how to decide who should take the next turn
5. how to allow the correct people to join the game
6. This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any detailed
design.
