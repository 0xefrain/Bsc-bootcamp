#Decentralised Systems

Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be
like, if there was no software on a central server.
How would you solve the problems of:

- cheating

Implementing blockchain we can store  all game  data on a decentralized network.All allowed members can monitor the data 
and the transactions in network public and can share between computers.The management and authorization 
of data are carried out transparently.

- ensuring agreement about the state of the system

Blockchain use proved and secure consesus mechanism to achieve distributed agreement about the ledger's state

- communication problems (timeouts)

Using Blockchains like Ethereum we can deploy our game apps on dristributed nodes around the world without a centralized server  these show more  resiliency to the 
network infrastructure and much less vulnerable to hacks or shutdowns , since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has never suffered downtime



4.how to decide who should take the next turn.

With help Blockchain Oracles like Chainlink VRF we can decide who take next turn providing randomness or predefined achievements


5.how to allow the correct people to join the game

Blockchain allow implementation of diferent access control mechanism for our game .
