 # Homework 6
 ## Badger NFT
We now want to create an NFT.
You can use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.
1. Create a new project in the IDE of your choice
2. Create a BadgerNFT contract this should inherit from any ERC721
implementation from the Open Zeppelin standard libraries
3. Give your NFT a name and a symbol.
4. Write unit tests to check that you can
 - Mint new NFTs
 - Transfer an NFT
5. Deploy your contract to the test network and send some NFTs to your
colleagues.
For now we won't associate a digital asset with our token.
